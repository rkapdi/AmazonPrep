variable values depend on an expression being true or false.

for e.g:
  if (a > b) {
    max  = a;
  } else{
    max = b;
  }
  
  can be written using the conditional operator in single line as:
  
  max = (a > b) ? a : b
  
  how does this work?
  
  -- the condition a > b is tested, if a is bigger, the first value following the ? is assigned to max.
